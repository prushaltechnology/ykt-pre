      review: `Enjoyed the yoga session with instructor Kavita. She was very helpful and gave sufficient time to each individual in getting the correct stance/ posture and ensured that we are not just doing it but understanding the benefits as well. One of the best instructor for yoga. Must try to experience it.

        review: `Kavita is an excellent yoga guide. In the classes which I have attended she uses relatively easy yoga positions but through personal feedback and focusing on small details of posture and breath she achieves deep effects. Her sessions are full of mindfulness. Highly recommended! A huge thank you for being such an amazing yoga teacher. I came away feeling restored from my currently demanding workload. And I had such a surge of energy. Amazing!

        review: `Kavita's online yoga classes were just what I needed.  I found the way she presented her class was unhurried and had options for the less flexible.  It was relaxing, yet invigorating.  She is very knowledgeable about poses and her voice is calming. Afterwards, I felt like my body had been stretched in a good way and my mind felt more peaceful. I thoroughly recommend her and her classes.

        review: `Excellent. The pranayam and breathing control sessions were very easy to understand and always dependent on the level of the students. I felt comfortable at all times, felt treated with love and respect. Kavita teaches more than just postures. Classes are one hour long and the price are very reasonable. Definitely will recommend for weightloss.

        review: `I'm pretty much a complete beginner the teacher had plenty of personal focus and paid attention to my postures. Kavita asked me about my personal issues and problems so gave extra attention because of my backache. She taught me breathing techniques and subtle yoga movements and exercise which gave me relief from my backache problems also helped me in inch loss and weight loss by giving me weekly diet plans. I'm sure the intermediate and advanced lessons are great as well, but I'd definitely recommend pranayam sessions if you're a beginner like me, and want to practice with a positive teacher who gives attention to everyone with their individual issues.
